have sync run in service worker to not freeze ui?

error dialogs while logging stuff


startup takes too long
home screen jumps when going back cuz loading recent activity is not instant
seed data multiplied with another device (seed only server db and sync down?)


This is a newly installed ubuntu server. Make sure it is properly secured with all the best practices including auto security updates etc.
My ssh key is already setup.
setup password for user root to be: root
setup user walter with password: walter

then switch to user walter and run these commands:

curl -fsSL https://bun.com/install | bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
